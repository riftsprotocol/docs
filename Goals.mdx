Rifts is a fully decentralized, permissionless protocol focused on turning market volatility into yield. Unlike traditional yield farming, which often relies on inflationary token emissions or unstable incentive models, Rifts builds a sustainable revenue loop from the natural behavior of token price fluctuations and arbitrage.

At the heart of Rifts, lies the concept of Pools—customizable, fully collateralized vaults that wrap SPL-20 tokens into programmable 'wrapped' synthetic assets (rTKNs). These rTKNs are composable, tradable, and earn revenue passively through market dynamics, arbitrage fees, and strategic buybacks.  \
\
Therefore, our goals consist of the three: \
\
— Provide safe volatility yield farming options on the Solana network\
— Decentralized & trustworthy yield alternatives for investors \
— Transparency on our process & functionality.
