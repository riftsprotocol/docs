Rifts is built with usability, efficiency, and trustlessness at its core. Here's how users benefit:

#### **For Token Holders**

- Reduced Trading Fees: Holding the RIFTS token gives access to lower fees across supported Pools.
- Custom Pool Access: Certain high-yield or experimental Pools are gated by RIFTS holdings, creating utility beyond speculation.
- Governance: Token holders will influence future protocol upgrades, fee structures, and strategic partnerships.
