Rifts captures value through multiple non-inflationary revenue streams, all of which drive value back to token holders and protocol users.

**Creators of Pools can configure:**

- Arbitrage fees
- Swap fees
- Wrap fees

These fees generate yield for the Pool creator and liquidity providers. Custom Pools allow strategic monetization, including gated access, private liquidity strategies, or exclusive DAO pools.
