#### **Exploit-Resistant Arbitrage Design**

Many protocols allow malicious actors to spam-trade or force artificial arbitrage against mispriced pools. Rifts Protocol is built differently:  — The oracle does not rely solely on user trades to update

— Prices adjust only when meaningful volume or elapsed time occurs

— This eliminates rapid-fire exploit scenarios where bots take advantage of “flash stale” pricing

By decoupling price updates from individual trades and tying them to broader liquidity behavior, Rifts Protocol becomes inherently resistant to manipulation—protecting both the protocol and its users from value extraction attacks.
