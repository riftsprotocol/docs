### **Current 'Growth' Model:**

#### **25% Buyback and Burn (RIFTS)**

- Buybacks: 25% of all fees collected (from arbitrage, swaps, flash loans, etc.) are used to buy RIFTS from the open market.
- Deflation: A portion of these tokens are permanently burned, reducing supply and increasing scarcity.
- Price Pressure: Consistent buybacks create continuous buy-side demand for the token.

This creates a snowball effect:

1. More Pools → more trades/arbitrage → more fees
2. More fees → more RIFTS bought & burned
3. Reduced supply → higher value for holders

#### **75% Reinvested into Custom Pools**

The remaining 75% of revenue is reinvested into:

- High-performing Pools
- Experimental index strategies
- Stability funds to reinforce peg maintenance

These reinvestments support innovation, increase liquidity, and help bootstrap new asset classes and indexes. All actions are visible and verifiable on-chain.

### **Long-term 'Holder-Focused' Model:**

To secure the most market adoption of the protocol, the previously mentioned model will be kept in the starting months of Rifts.  However, the Long-term model, which is the Rifts team initial vision, is going to permanently replace it, since this maximizes potential profit for holders, while keeping growth at a constant growth phase.  The long-term model refer to **75% **of revenue going into **buybacks **with **25%** going into pool re-investing/project **treasury**.
