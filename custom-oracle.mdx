Rifts Protocol stands apart from typical DeFi platforms by addressing core vulnerabilities in most liquidity and synthetic asset systems—oracle lag, manipulation exploits, and low-volume vulnerabilities.

#### **Self-Updating Oracle System**

Unlike protocols that rely on outdated or external oracles, Rifts Protocol features a self-adjusting oracle mechanism that:   — Updates based on both time and volume thresholds

— Prevents price drift during periods of low trading activity

— Ensures that Pool values remain accurate, even without constant user input

This protects pool creators from losses due to underpriced redemptions or arbitrage based on stale pricing data.
