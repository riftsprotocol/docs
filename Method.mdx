## **Creating a Pool**

A Pool is a smart contract wrapper around one or more SPL-20 tokens. Once deployed, it issues a new token (rTKN) that represents 1:1 collateralized ownership of the underlying asset(s). These pools can be configured with dynamic properties such as fee structure, burn rates, and allowed liquidity behaviors.

Pools may include:

- Single-asset vaults (e.g., AVC→ rAVC)
- Index vaults that blend multiple tokens (e.g., 40% rSOL, 30% rAVC, 30% rRifts)
