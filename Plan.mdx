### **Phase 1: Arbitrage Foundation (Q4 2025)**

**Goal:** Establish single-asset arbitrage pools and incentivize protocol participation

#### **Updates:**

— Single-Asset ranged pools (of any SPL token) - also known as Monopools. — Users add tokens to single-asset pools to generate an extra income from rifted arbitrage, while also being able to remove liquidity at any time.

#### **Advantages:**

— Arbitrage profit share — Boosted rTKN yields — Deeper liquidity for the main token pool, since ranged positions absorb both buys and sells.

### **Phase 2: Multi-Asset Rifts**

**Goal:** Combine multiple volatile assets into yield-maximized pools

#### **Updates:**

— Multi-Asset rTKN Vaults — Users deposit 2–5 assets into a vault that mints a single synthetic (e.g., rRIFT-AVCTOKENrSOL)

#### **Advantages:**

— Arbitrages volatility across all input assets — Internal balancing logic for price divergence — Possibility for balance & backing to avoid impermanent loss

### **Phase 3: Yield & Lending Layer**

**Goal:** Enable users to lend assets to others for collaborative volatility farming

#### **Updates & Advantages:**

— Volatility Lending Pools — Users lend TOKEN, SOL, or RIFTS → borrowers deploy into Rifts — Lenders earn a % of base arbitrage yield + % of Rift profits — Borrowers become leveraged on rToken(s)
