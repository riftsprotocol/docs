The protocol allows users to wrap any SPL token into "rift tokens" (e.g., rSOL, rToken) that maintain backing ratios through automated rebalancing mechanisms.

- Wrap any SPL token into rift tokens with 0.3% fees
- Unwrap rift tokens back to underlying assets
- Dynamic backing ratios that increase over time through burns
- Real time arbitrage and oracle-triggered rebalancing for price stability

**Tokenomics**

- Wrap fees: 0.3% of fees burn underlying tokens (configurable per rift), kept by Rifts Treasury.
- Token fees: 1% fees charged on Rifts. This is to prevent competition on arbitrage & make an income off potential arbitrage bots which are not run by the Rifts team.
- Treasury: 0.25% meteora fees, out of which 86.6% can be claimed by the deployer of the rift (user).
- Arbitrage profits: 50% to the user, 50% to the Rifts Treasury. On the long-term, arbitrage will automatically run on every created Rift. Special partners can capture up to 80% of the profits.
